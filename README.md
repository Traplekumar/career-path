CareerPath leverages Generative AI and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). With CareerPath, users can upload a LinkedIn profile URL and specify their desired career. The application extracts data from the LinkedIn profile, utilizes the Metaphor API to outline the necessary steps for pursuing the chosen career, and employs the OpenAI API in the backend to generate the output text. The application not only highlights the user's strengths and weaknesses related to their chosen career but also provides a comprehensive guide on the steps to pursue that career.
